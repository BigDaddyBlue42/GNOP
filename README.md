# Gnop

Welcome to GNOP! by Michael Graves, Benjamin Guzman, and Ryan Gualding.

Player 1 is on the left side. Use W and S to move up and down. 

Player 2 is the CPU, but can become playable by pressing "2".

The ball is the face of a young Mr. Watson, but you can change it to a normal ball by pressing the space bar.

There are many powerups in the game! They are helpful in beating the AI. Have fun figuring out what each does!

First to 5 points wins!
